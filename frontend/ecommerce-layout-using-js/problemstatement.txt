Machine Coding Question
Problem Statement:
You are tasked with creating a dynamic webpage layout similar to an e-commerce homepage (like Flipkart). Your goal is to build this layout using Vanilla JavaScript.
Requirements:
1. Dynamic Layout:
    * You will receive a nested JSON object from an API that represents various containers and widgets.
    * Each container can contain multiple widgets, and each widget has properties like id, width, and color.
2. Rendering:
    * Create a function that takes the nested object and dynamically renders the entire layout on a webpage.
    * Each widget should be styled according to its width and color properties.
3. Responsive Design:
    * The layout should be responsive. Ensure that widgets stack vertically on smaller screens and align horizontally on larger screens.
4. Search Functionality:
    * Implement a search bar that filters the displayed widgets based on their id. When a user types an id, only the matching widget(s) should be displayed.
5. Code Structure:
    * Write modular and reusable code. Use functions to handle specific tasks such as rendering containers and widgets.
    * Ensure your code is well-organized and easy to understand.
Example Input:
json
Copy code
{
  "containers": [
    {
      "id": "header",
      "widgets": [
        { "id": "search", "width": "100%", "color": "lightgrey" }
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "banner",
      "widgets": [
        { "id": "promo", "width": "100%", "color": "blue" }
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "products",
      "widgets": [
        { "id": "prod1", "width": "30%", "color": "green" },
        { "id": "prod2", "width": "30%", "color": "red" },
        { "id": "prod3", "width": "30%", "color": "yellow" }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
Example Output:
* The webpage should display a header with a search bar, a banner with a promotional widget, and a product catalog with three product widgets, all styled according to their specified widths and colors.
* The search bar should filter the widgets as the user types.
Constraints:
* You have 2 hours to complete this task.
* Focus on writing clean, modular, and responsive code.
Evaluation Criteria:
* Correctness: Does the layout render correctly based on the provided input?
* Modularity: Is the code structured in a modular way, making it easy to read and maintain?
* Responsiveness: Does the layout adapt well to different screen sizes?
* Search Functionality: Does the search bar work as expected, filtering widgets by id?
